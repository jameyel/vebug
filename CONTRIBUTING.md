# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Vebug! Feel free to file issue reports, submit PRs and propose any necessary documentation.

Before you open a PR:

- In development, run `yarn start:dev` to build (and watch) the example project source, and run
  the [development server](http://localhost:8000).
- Please ensure all the tool works correctly after your change.
- Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to
  the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.
- Make sure there's an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit
  as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction
  early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.
- If you open an issue and are interested in working on a fix, please let us
  know. We'll help you get started, rather than inadvertently doubling up on your hard work.
- Make sure you do not add regressions by running `yarn test`.
- Where possible, include tests with your changes, either that demonstrates the
  bug, or tests the new functionality. If you're not sure how to test your
  changes, feel free to ping @stackcache
- Please [follow our established coding conventions](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/wiki/Coding-Standards)
  (with regards to formatting, etc)
- All new features and changes need documentation.
